'''
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

a2 + b2 = c2
For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.

# ------------------- WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO?
# evaluate pythag statement - a**2 + b**2 = c**

# example - 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2 - 9 + 16 + 25 = 50
#	3 + 4 + 5 = 12
#	3 * 4 * 5 = 60
